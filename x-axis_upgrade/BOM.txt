  There may be other X-axis/Extruder bits in the other sections as well.

Pick which full plate is more appropriate to print:
  t-max_x-end_upgrade_plate_E3Dv5_BLTouch.stl
  t-max_x-end_upgrade_plate_E3Dv6_BLTouch.stl
  t-max_x-end_upgrade_plate_E3Dv6_Induction.stl

The E3Dv6-sized cooling_fan was taken from the source at 
  https://github.com/paenian/i3_parts/tree/master/bg9, and the BLTouch from my repo at 
  https://github.com/twstdpear/i3_parts/tree/master/BLTouch

There is no E3Dv5+Induction plate. The E3Dv5 is ~8mm taller than the v6.  In theory, the 
regular induction mount for the E3Dv6 should work, just with more of the induction sensor
shifed down below the mount.  I no longer use one, so I don't have a way to test.  Print
the E3Dv5_BLTouch plate, print the induction mount separately and give it a whirl.  Make sure
you read about the sensor and required voltage divider in the Nova Labs i3 Instructions mentioned above.

on the rod and pop the balls out.
